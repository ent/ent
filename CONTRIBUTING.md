# Run integration tests
If you touch any file in `entc`, run the following command in `entc`:

```
go generate ./...
```

Then, in `entc/inegration` run `docker-compose` in order to spin-up all database containers:

```
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose.yaml up -d --scale test=0
```

Then, run `go test ./...` to run all integration tests.
