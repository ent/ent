[Postgres extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) are add-on modules that extend
the functionality of the database by providing new data types, operators, functions, procedural languages, and more.

This guide explains how to define a schema field that uses a data type provided by the PostGIS extension, and configure
the schema migration to manage both Postgres extension installations and the Ent schema as a single migration unit using
Atlas.

:::info [Atlas Pro Feature](https://atlasgo.io/features#pro-plan)
Atlas support for [Extensions](https://atlasgo.io/atlas-schema/hcl#extension) is available exclusively to Pro users.
To use this feature, run:
```
atlas login
```
:::

## Install Atlas

<InstallationInstructions />

## Login to Atlas

```shell
$ atlas login a8m
//highlight-next-line-info
You are now connected to "a8m" on Atlas Cloud.
```

## Composite Schema

An `ent/schema` package is mostly used for defining Ent types (objects), their fields, edges and logic. Extensions like
`postgis` or `hstore` do not have representation in Ent schema. A Postgres extension can be installed once in your
Postgres database, and may be used multiple times in different schemas.

In order to extend our PostgreSQL schema migration to include both extensions and our Ent types, we configure Atlas to
read the state of the schema from a [Composite Schema](https://atlasgo.io/atlas-schema/projects#data-source-composite_schema)
data source. Follow the steps below to configure this for your project:

1\. Create a `schema.sql` that defines the necessary extensions used by your database. In the same way, you can define
the extensions in [Atlas Schema HCL language](https://atlasgo.io/atlas-schema/hcl-types#extension):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value={"sql"} label={"Using SQL"}>

```sql title="schema.sql"
-- Install PostGIS extension.
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={"hcl"} label={"Using HCL"}>

```hcl title="schema.hcl"
schema "public" {}

extension "postgis" {
  schema  = schema.public
  version = "3.4.2"
  comment = "PostGIS geometry and geography spatial types and functions"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2\. In your Ent schema, define a field that uses the data type provided by the extension. In this example, we use the
`GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)` data type provided by the `postgis` extension:

```go title="ent/schema/user.go" {7-9}
// Fields of the User.
func (User) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.Bytes("location").
			// Ideally, we would use a custom GoType
			// to represent the "geometry" type.
			SchemaType(map[string]string{
				dialect.Postgres: "GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)",
			}),
	}
}
```

3\. Create a simple `atlas.hcl` config file with a `composite_schema` that includes both the extensions defined in
   `schema.sql` and your Ent schema:

```hcl title="atlas.hcl"
data "composite_schema" "app" {
  # Install extensions first (PostGIS).
  schema "public" {
    url = "file://schema.sql"
  }
  # Then, load the Ent schema.
  schema "public" {
    url = "ent://ent/schema"
  }
}

env "local" {
  src = data.composite_schema.app.url
  dev = "docker://postgis/latest/dev"
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

After setting up our composite schema, we can get its representation using the `atlas schema inspect` command, generate
schema migrations for it, apply them to a database, and more. Below are a few commands to get you started with Atlas:

#### Inspect the Schema

The `atlas schema inspect` command is commonly used to inspect databases. However, we can also use it to inspect our
`composite_schema` and print the SQL representation of it:

```shell
atlas schema inspect \
  --env local \
  --url env://src \
  --format '{{ sql . }}'
```

The command above prints the following SQL.

```sql
-- Add new schema named "public"
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "public";
-- Set comment to schema: "public"
COMMENT ON SCHEMA "public" IS 'standard public schema';
-- Create extension "postgis"
CREATE EXTENSION "postgis" WITH SCHEMA "public" VERSION "3.4.2";
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE "public"."users" ("id" bigint NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY, "location" public.geometry(point,4326) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));
```

:::info Extensions Are Database-Level Objects
Although the `SCHEMA` argument is supported by the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, it only indicates where the extension's
objects will be installed. The extension itself is installed at the database level and cannot be loaded multiple times
into different schemas.

Therefore, to avoid conflicts with other schemas, when working with extensions, the scope of the migration should be set
to the database, where objects are qualified with the schema name. Hence, the `search_path` is dropped from the dev-database
URL in the `atlas.hcl` file.
:::

#### Generate Migrations For the Schema

To generate a migration for the schema, run the following command:

```shell
atlas migrate diff \
  --env local
```

Note that a new migration file is created with the following content:

```sql title="migrations/20240712090543.sql"
-- Create extension "postgis"
CREATE EXTENSION "postgis" WITH SCHEMA "public" VERSION "3.4.2";
-- Create "users" table
CREATE TABLE "public"."users" (
  "id" bigint NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  "location" public.geometry(point,4326) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

#### Apply the Migrations

To apply the migration generated above to a database, run the following command:

```
atlas migrate apply \
  --env local \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/database?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```

:::info Apply the Schema Directly on the Database

Sometimes, there is a need to apply the schema directly to the database without generating a migration file. For example,
when experimenting with schema changes, spinning up a database for testing, etc. In such cases, you can use the command
below to apply the schema directly to the database:

```shell
atlas schema apply \
  --env local \
  --url "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable"
```

Or, using the [Atlas Go SDK](https://github.com/ariga/atlas-go-sdk):

```go
ac, err := atlasexec.NewClient(".", "atlas")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("failed to initialize client: %w", err)
}
// Automatically update the database with the desired schema.
// Another option, is to use 'migrate apply' or 'schema apply' manually.
if _, err := ac.SchemaApply(ctx, &atlasexec.SchemaApplyParams{
	Env: "local",
	URL: "postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable",
	AutoApprove: true,
}); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to apply schema changes: %w", err)
}
```
