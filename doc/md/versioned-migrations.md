If you are using the Atlas migration engine you are able to use the versioned migrations feature of it. Instead of
applying the computed changes directly to the database, it will generate a set of migration files containing the
necessary SQL statements to migrate the database. These files can then be edited to your needs and be applied by any
tool you like (like golang-migrate, Flyway, liquibase).

## Generating Versioned Migration Files

### From Client

If you want to use an instantiated Ent client to create new migration files, you have to enable the versioned
migrations feature flag in order to have Ent make the necessary changes to the generated code. Depending on how you
execute the Ent code generator, you have to use one of the two options:

1. If you are using the default go generate configuration, simply add the `--feature sql/versioned-migration` to
   the `ent/generate.go` file as follows:

```go
package ent

//go:generate go run -mod=mod entgo.io/ent/cmd/ent generate --feature sql/versioned-migration ./schema
```

2. If you are using the code generation package (e.g. if you are using an Ent extension), add the feature flag as
   follows:

```go
//go:build ignore

package main

import (
	"log"

	"entgo.io/ent/entc"
	"entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
)

func main() {
	err := entc.Generate("./schema", &gen.Config{}, entc.FeatureNames("sql/versioned-migration"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("running ent codegen: %v", err)
	}
}
```

After regenerating the project, there will be an extra `Diff` method on the Ent client that you can use to inspect the
connected database, compare it with the schema definitions and create SQL statements needed to migrate the database to
the graph.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    "<project>/ent"

    "ariga.io/atlas/sql/migrate"
    "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql/schema"
   _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ent.Open("mysql", "root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/test")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed connecting to mysql: %v", err)
	}
	defer client.Close()
	ctx := context.Background()
	// Create a local migration directory.
	dir, err := migrate.NewLocalDir("migrations")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed creating atlas migration directory: %v", err)
	}
	// Write migration diff.
	err = client.Schema.Diff(ctx, schema.WithDir(dir))
	// You can use the following method to give the migration files a name.
	// err = client.Schema.NamedDiff(ctx, "migration_name", schema.WithDir(dir))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed creating schema resources: %v", err)
	}
}
```

You can then create a new set of migration files by simply calling `go run -mod=mod main.go`.

### From Graph

You can also generate new migration files without an instantiated Ent client. This can be useful if you want to make the
migration file creation part of a go generate workflow. Note, that in this case enabling the feature flag is optional.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    "ariga.io/atlas/sql/migrate"
    "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql"
    "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql/schema"
    "entgo.io/ent/entc"
    "entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
)

func main() {
    // Load the graph.
    graph, err := entc.LoadGraph("./schema", &gen.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    tbls, err := graph.Tables()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    // Create a local migration directory.
    d, err := migrate.NewLocalDir("migrations")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    // Open connection to the database.
    dlct, err := sql.Open("mysql", "root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/test")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    // Inspect it and compare it with the graph.
    m, err := schema.NewMigrate(dlct, schema.WithDir(d))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    if err := m.Diff(context.Background(), tbls...); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    // You can use the following method to give the migration files a name.
    // if err := m.NamedDiff(context.Background(), "migration_name", tbls...); err != nil {
    //     log.Fatalln(err)
    // }
}
```

## Apply Migrations

The Atlas migration engine does not support applying the migration files onto a database yet, therefore to manage and
execute the generated migration files, you have to rely on an external tool (or execute them by hand). By default, Atlas
generates one "up" and one "down" migration file for the computed diff. These files are compatible with the popular
[golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) package, and you can use that tool to manage the
migrations in your deployments.

```shell
migrate -source file://migrations -database mysql://root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/test up
```

## Moving from Auto-Migration to Versioned Migrations

In case you already have an Ent application in production and want to switch over from auto migration to the new
versioned migration, you need to take some extra steps.

1. Create an initial migration file (or several files if you want) reflecting the currently deployed state.

   To do this make sure your schema definition is in sync with your deployed version. Then spin up an empty database and
   run the diff command once as described above. This will create the statements needed to create the current state of
   your schema graph.

2. Configure the tool you use to manage migrations to consider this file as **applied**.

   In case of `golang-migrate` this can be done by forcing your database version as
   described [here](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#forcing-your-database-version).

## Use a Custom Formatter

Atlas' migration engine comes with great customizability. By the use of a custom `Formatter` you can generate the
migration files in a format compatible with other migration management tools and Atlas has built-in support for the
following four:

1. [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
2. [pressly/goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)
3. [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
4. [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/)

:::note
You need to have the latest master of Ent installed for this to be working. 

```shell
go get -u entgo.io/ent@master
```
:::

```go
package main

import (
   "context"
   "log"
   "strings"
   "text/template"
   "time"

   "ariga.io/atlas/sql/migrate"
   "ariga.io/atlas/sql/sqltool"
   "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql"
   "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql/schema"
   "entgo.io/ent/entc"
   "entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
)

func main() {
   // Load the graph.
   graph, err := entc.LoadGraph("/.schema", &gen.Config{})
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   tbls, err := graph.Tables()
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Create a local migration directory.
   d, err := migrate.NewLocalDir("migrations")
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Open connection to the database.
   dlct, err := sql.Open("mysql", "root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/test")
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Inspect it and compare it with the graph.
   m, err := schema.NewMigrate(dlct, schema.WithDir(d),
      // highlight-start
      // Chose one of the below.
      schema.WithFormatter(sqltool.GolangMigrateFormatter),
      schema.WithFormatter(sqltool.GooseFormatter),
      schema.WithFormatter(sqltool.FlywayFormatter),
      schema.WithFormatter(sqltool.LiquibaseFormatter),
      // highlight-end
   )
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   if err := m.Diff(context.Background(), tbls...); err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
}
```

### Note for using golang-migrate

If you use golang-migrate with MySQL, you need to add the `multiStatements` parameter to `true` as in the example below and then take the DSN we used in the documents with the param applied.

```
"user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname?multiStatements=true"
```

## Atlas migration directory integrity file

### The Problem

Suppose you have multiple teams develop a feature in parallel and both of them need a migration. If Team A and Team B do
not check in with each other, they might end up with a broken set of migration files (like adding the same table or
column twice) since new files do not raise a merge conflict in a version control system like git. The following example
demonstrates such behavior:

![atlas-versioned-migrations-no-conflict](https://entgo.io/images/assets/migrate/no-conflict.svg)

Assume both Team A and Team B add a new schema called User and generate a versioned migration file on their respective
branch.

```sql title="20220318104614_team_A.sql"
-- create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    // highlight-start
    `team_a_col` INTEGER NOT NULL,
    // highlight-end
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
```

```sql title="20220318104615_team_B.sql"
-- create "users" table
CREATE TABLE `users` (
    `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    // highlight-start
     `team_b_col` INTEGER NOT NULL,
    // highlight-end
     PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
```

If they both merge their branch into master, git will not raise a conflict and everything seems fine. But attempting to
apply the pending migrations will result in migration failure:

```shell
mysql> CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `team_a_col` INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
[2022-04-14 10:00:38] completed in 31 ms

mysql> CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `team_b_col` INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) CHARSET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
[2022-04-14 10:00:48] [42S01][1050] Table 'users' already exists
```

Depending on the SQL this can potentially leave your database in a crippled state.

### The Solution

Luckily, the Atlas migration engine offers a way to prevent concurrent creation of new migration files and guard against
accidental changes in the migration history we call **Migration Directory Integrity File**, which simply is another file
in your migration directory called `atlas.sum`. For the migration directory of team A it would look similar to this:

```text
h1:KRFsSi68ZOarsQAJZ1mfSiMSkIOZlMq4RzyF//Pwf8A=
20220318104614_team_A.sql h1:EGknG5Y6GQYrc4W8e/r3S61Aqx2p+NmQyVz/2m8ZNwA=

```

The `atlas.sum` file contains the checksum of each migration file (implemented by a reverse, one branch merkle hash
tree), and a sum of all files. Adding new files results in a change to the sum file, which will raise merge conflicts in
most version controls systems. Let's see how we can use the **Migration Directory Integrity File** to detect the case
from above automatically.

:::note
Please note, that you need to have the Atlas CLI installed in your system for this to work, so make sure to follow
the [installation instructions](https://atlasgo.io/cli/getting-started/setting-up#install-the-cli) before proceeding.
:::

The first step is to tell the migration engine to create a sum file by using the `schema.WithSumFile()` option:

```go
package main

import (
   "context"
   "log"

   "ariga.io/atlas/sql/migrate"
   "ariga.io/atlas/sql/sqltool"
   "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql"
   "entgo.io/ent/dialect/sql/schema"
   "entgo.io/ent/entc"
   "entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
)

func main() {
   // Load the graph.
   graph, err := entc.LoadGraph("/.schema", &gen.Config{})
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   tbls, err := graph.Tables()
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Create a local migration directory.
   d, err := migrate.NewLocalDir("migrations")
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Open connection to the database.
   dlct, err := sql.Open("mysql", "root:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/test")
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   // Inspect it and compare it with the graph.
   m, err := schema.NewMigrate(dlct, schema.WithDir(d),
      // highlight-start
      // Enable the Atlas Migration Directory Integrity File.
      schema.WithSumFile(),
      // highlight-end
   )
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
   if err := m.Diff(context.Background(), tbls...); err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
   }
}
```

In addition to the usual `.sql` migration files the migration directory will contain the `atlas.sum` file. Every time
you let Ent generate a new migration file, this file is updated for you. However, every manual change made to the
mitration directory will render the migration directory and the `atlas.sum` file out-of-sync. With the Atlas CLI you can
both check if the file and migration directory are in-sync, and fix it if not:

```shell
# If there is no output, the migration directory is in-sync.
atlas migrate validate --dir file://<path-to-your-migration-directory>
```

```shell
# If the migration directory and sum file are out-of-sync the Atlas CLI will tell you.
atlas migrate validate --dir file://<path-to-your-migration-directory>
Error: checksum mismatch

You have a checksum error in your migration directory.
This happens if you manually create or edit a migration file.
Please check your migration files and run

'atlas migrate hash --force'

to re-hash the contents and resolve the error.

exit status 1
```

If you are sure, that the contents in your migration files are correct, you can re-compute the hashes in the `atlas.sum`
file:

```shell
# Recompute the sum file.
atlas migrate hash --dir file://<path-to-your-migration-directory> --force
```

Back to the problem above, if team A would land their changes on master first and team B would now attempt to land
theirs, they'd get a merge conflict, as you can see in the example below:

![atlas-versioned-migrations-no-conflict](https://entgo.io/images/assets/migrate/conflict.svg)

You can add the `atlas migrate validate` call to your CI to have the migration directory checked continuously. Even if
any team member would now forget to update the `atlas.sum` file after a manual edit, the CI would not go green,
indicating a problem.
