## MySQL

MySQL supports all the features that are mentioned in the [Migration](migrate.md) section,
and it's being tested constantly on the following 3 versions: `5.6.35`, `5.7.26` and `8`. 

## MariaDB

MariaDB supports all the features that are mentioned in the [Migration](migrate.md) section,
and it's being tested constantly on the following 3 versions: `10.2`, `10.3` and latest version.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL supports all the features that are mentioned in the [Migration](migrate.md) section,
and it's being tested constantly on the following 4 versions: `10`, `11`, `12` and `13`.

## SQLite

SQLite supports all _"append-only"_ features mentioned in the [Migration](migrate.md) section. 
However, dropping or modifying resources, like [drop-index](migrate.md#drop-resources) are not
supported by default by SQLite, and will be added in the future using a [temporary table](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#otheralter).

## Gremlin

Gremlin does not support migration nor indexes, and **<ins>it's considered experimental</ins>**.

## TiDB - **<ins>preview</ins>**

TiDB support is in preview and requires the [Atlas migration engine](#atlas-integration).  
TiDB is MySQL compatible and thus any feature that works on MySQL _should_ work on TiDB as well.  
For a list of known compatibility issues, visit: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/mysql-compatibility  
The integration with TiDB is currently tested on version `5.4.0`.
