## Upgrading our production database to use versioned migrations

If you have been following our tutorial to this point, you may be asking yourself how do we
upgrade the production instance of our database to be managed by the versioned migraions workflow? 
With local development, we can just delete the database and start over, but that is not an option
for production for obvious reasons.

Like many other database schema management tools, [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) uses a metadata table
on the target database to keep track of which migrations were already applied.
In the case where we start using Atlas on an existing database, we must somehow
inform Atlas that all migrations up to a certain version were already applied.

To illustrate this, let's try to run Atlas's `migrate apply` command on a database
that is currently managed by an auto-migration workflow using the migration directory that we just
created. Notice that we use a connection string to a database that _already has_ the application schema
instantiated (we use the `/db` suffix to indicate that we want to connect to the `db` database).

```text
atlas migrate apply --dir file://ent/migrate/migrations --url mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/db
```

Atlas returns an error:

```text
Error: sql/migrate: connected database is not clean: found table "atlas_schema_revisions" in schema "db". baseline version or allow-dirty is required
```

This error is expected, as this is the first time we are running Atlas on this database, but as the error said
we need to "baseline" the database. This means that we tell Atlas that the database is already at a certain state
that correlates with one of the versions in the migration directory.

To fix this, we use the `--baseline` flag to tell Atlas that the database is already at
a certain version:

```text
atlas migrate apply --dir file://ent/migrate/migrations --url mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/db --baseline 20221114165732
```

Atlas reports that there's nothing new to run:

```text
No migration files to execute
```

That's better! Next, let's verify that Atlas is aware of what migrations
were already applied by using the `migrate status` command:

```text
atlas migrate status --dir file://ent/migrate/migrations --url mysql://root:pass@localhost:3306/db
```
Atlas reports:
```text
Migration Status: OK
  -- Current Version: 20221114165732
  -- Next Version:    Already at latest version
  -- Executed Files:  1
  -- Pending Files:   0
```
Great! We have successfully upgraded our project to use versioned migrations with Atlas.

Next, let's see how we add a new migration to our project when we make a change to our
Ent schema.
