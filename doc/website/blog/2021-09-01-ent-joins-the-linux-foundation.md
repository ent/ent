Dear community,

I’m really happy to share something that has been in the works for quite some time.
Yesterday (August 31st), a [press release](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/ent-joins-the-linux-foundation/)
was issued announcing that Ent is joining the Linux Foundation.


Ent was open-sourced while I was working on it with my peers at Facebook in 2019. Since then, our community has
grown, and we’ve seen the adoption of Ent explode across many organizations of different sizes and sectors. 

Our goal with moving under the governance of the Linux Foundation is to provide a corporate-neutral environment in
which organizations can more easily contribute code, as we’ve seen with other successful OSS projects such as Kubernetes
and GraphQL. In addition, the move under the governance of the Linux Foundation positions Ent where we would like it to
be, a core, infrastructure technology that organizations can trust because it is guaranteed to be here for a long time.

In terms of our community, nothing in particular changes, the repository has already moved to [github.com/ent/ent](https://github.com/ent/ent)
a few  months ago, the license remains Apache 2.0, and we are all 100% committed to the success of the project. We’re sure
that the Linux Foundation’s strong brand and organizational capabilities will help to build even more confidence in Ent
and further foster its adoption in the industry.

I wanted to express my deep gratitude to the amazing folks at Facebook and the Linux Foundation that have worked hard on
making this change possible and showing trust in our community to keep pushing the state-of-the-art in data access
frameworks. This is a big achievement for our community, and so I want to take a moment to thank all of you for your 
contributions, support, and trust in this project. 

On a personal note, I wanted to share that [Rotem](https://github.com/rotemtam) (a core contributor to Ent)
and I have founded a new company, [Ariga](https://ariga.io).
We’re on a mission to build something that we call an “operational data graph” that is heavily built using Ent, we will
be sharing more details on that in the near future. You can expect to see many new exciting features contributed to the
framework by our team. In addition, Ariga employees will dedicate time and resources to support and foster this wonderful
community.

If you have any questions about this change or have any ideas on how to make it even better, please don’t hesitate to
reach out to me on our [Slack channel](https://entgo.io/docs/slack/).
